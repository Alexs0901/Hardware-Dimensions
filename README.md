#Hardware-Dimensions
Hardware dimensions usable in mechanical design.

##Function
Dimensions are stored in Open Document Spreadsheets (ods). CSV and JSON files generated by the build.sh script are available. LibreOffice is used to generate the CSV files.

The CSV is parsed by the `csv_to_json.py` Python script which creates a JSON file with the following format...
```JSON
{
"filename" : [
    { 
    "Row1, Col1" : "Row2, Col1",
    "Row1, Col2" : "Row2, Col2",
    },
     { 
    "Row1, Col1" : "Row3, Col1",
    "Row1, Col2" : "Row3, Col2",
    }
    ]
}   
```
The keys are pulled from the first row and applied to each row below as a group.
Numeric values will be stored as such, removing the quotation marks around the value.
